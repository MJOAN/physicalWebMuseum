INSERT INTO exhibit (description) VALUES ('Starry Night Over the Rhône (September 1888) is one of Vincent van Gogh 
	paintings of Arles at nighttime. It was painted at a spot on the bank of the Rhône that was only a one or two-minute walk 
	from the Yellow House on the Place Lamartine which Van Gogh was renting at the time. The night sky and the effects of 
	light at night provided the subject for some of his more famous paintings, including Cafe Terrace at Night 
	(painted earlier the same month) and the later canvas from Saint Rémy, The Starry Night.');
