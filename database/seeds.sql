VALUES ('abbotsdream', 'Abbot’s Dream', 'In 1898, a coin toss would change the course of Abbot Kinney and what became known as the Venice of America. At 16 years old, Abott Kinney went on a walking tour of Venice and the Italian Riviera, leaving a significant lasting impression. In 1880 Kinney came to San Francisco and purchased land nearby and named it Kinneloa. In 1886, he built a summer home for he and his wife in Santa Monica. Kinney partnered with Francis Ryan and bought controlling interest in the Pacific Ocean Casino and a tract of land 1.5 miles long.  They built a pier, golf course, horse-racing track, boardwalk and other resort amenities.  Later Ryan died and his widow sold their half of interest to another group of men. With a flip of a coin, Kinney won the marshy southern half to build his “Venice of America.” Kinney’s dream was to cater to the beach-goers and summer holiday guests who frequented the communitys many amusement attractions. Venice came to be known as the Coney Island of the Pacific. Visitors were dazzled by the system of canals complete with gondolas and gondoliers brought in from Venice, Italy. There were ornate Venetian-style businesses and a full-sized amusement pier, and a miniature steam railroad ran on a 21⁄2-miles of tracks around the entire park. Eventually in 1911, Kinney changed the city’s name from Ocean Park to Venice',
